## **Objective:**

The goal of this project was to analyze the landscape of data professionals by examining key factors like salary, job satisfaction, programming language preferences, and geographical distribution. This analysis provides insights into the data industry, helping aspiring data professionals understand the trends and challenges they might face.

## **Dataset Overview:**

The dataset used for this analysis was based on survey responses from 630 data professionals across various job titles, countries, and experience levels. Key fields include respondent country, job title, programming language preference, work-life balance satisfaction, salary satisfaction, and difficulty level in breaking into the data field.

## **Key Insights:**

1. **Programming Language Preferences**: Python is the dominant programming language, significantly ahead of others like R and JavaScript.
2. **Salary Insights**: Data Scientists and Data Engineers have the highest average annual salaries, while students and entry-level positions report the lowest.
3. **Difficulty in Entering the Field**: A significant portion of respondents found it neither easy nor difficult to break into the data field, with fewer finding it very difficult or very easy.
4. **Work-Life and Salary Satisfaction**: The average work-life balance satisfaction is 5.74/10, while salary satisfaction is slightly lower at 4.27/10, indicating room for improvement in both areas.

## **Dashboard Design:**

* **Visualizations**:

  * Treemap for Respondent’s Country
  * Stacked Bar Chart for Favorite Programming Languages by Job Title
  * Donut Chart for Difficulty Level to Break into Data
  * Horizontal Bar Chart for Average Annual Salary by Job Title
  * Gauge Charts for Work-Life Balance and Salary Satisfaction
* **Design Approach**: The dashboard was designed with a clean and professional look, focusing on readability and ease of interpretation. Key metrics like the number of respondents and their average age are prominently displayed.

## **Challenges & Learnings:**

Creating this dashboard helped in refining skills in Power BI, particularly in handling complex datasets and creating dynamic visualizations. A challenge faced was ensuring that the visualizations were both comprehensive and concise, allowing users to derive insights quickly.

## **Conclusion:**

This project provided a deeper understanding of the data industry and its professionals. The insights gained from the analysis are valuable for anyone looking to enter or progress within the data field, offering a clear picture of the current landscape and future trends.
